# Vehicle-Routing-Logistics-Problem
## Overview:
## This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve a global logistics problem, the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The VRP is a classic combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of locations, starting and ending at a central depot. The objectives of this implementation are to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles and to balance the load among them.

# Features:
# Random Location Generation: Generates random (x, y) coordinates for a specified number of locations.
# Depot Location: Fixed central depot from which all vehicles start and end their routes.
# Multiple Vehicles: Allows for multiple vehicles to service the locations.
# Genetic Algorithm Optimization: Uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the routes for minimum total distance and balanced load among vehicles.
# Visualization: Plots the optimal routes for the vehicles.
